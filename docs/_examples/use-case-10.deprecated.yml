# Example 10: Transform all domains to lowercase
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000

  # Print DNS messages on standard output with TEXT format
  # with on tranformation to reduce qname to lowercase
  # For example: Wwww.GooGlE.com will be equal to www.google.com
  loggers:
    - name: console
      stdout:
        mode: text
      transforms:
        normalize:
          qname-lowercase: true

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to standard output
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [console]
