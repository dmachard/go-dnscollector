# Example 11: Add geographical metadata with GeoIP
#
# As prerequisites, we assume you have 
# - a DNS server which supports DNSTap (unbound, bind, powerdns, etc) for more informations about dnstap, 
#   read the following page: https://dmachard.github.io/posts/0001-dnstap-testing/

# If turned on, debug messages are printed in the standard output
global:
  trace:
    verbose: true

multiplexer:
  # Listen on tcp/6000 for incoming DNSTap protobuf messages from dns servers
  # with add country name in metadata
  collectors:
    - name: tap
      dnstap:
        listen-ip: 0.0.0.0
        listen-port: 6000
      transforms:
        geoip:
          mmdb-country-file: "/tmp/GeoIP/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"

  # Print DNS messages on standard output with TEXT format
  # Configure a custom text format to display the country name
  loggers:
    - name: console
      stdout:
        mode: text
        text-format: "localtime identity queryip qname qtype rcode country"

  # Routes DNS messages from the tap collector to standard output
  routes:
    - from: [tap]
      to: [console]
